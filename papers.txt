FMOODS2010-typeanalysis
Static Type Analysis of Pattern Matching by Abstract Interpretation
This paper presents a type analysis implemented in Sample. This analysis is focused on the prove of some properties of code containing pattern matchings in Scala.

ICFEM11-StringAnalysis
Static Analysis of String Values
This paper presents several analyses over string values. These analyses range from simple ones (the contained surely or possibly contained in a string, the prefix and the suffix) to something more complex (briks and string graphs). This work is based on Giulia Costantini's master thesis, and it is co-signed by Pietro and Agostino Cortesi.

VMCAI12-InferenceAccessPermissions
This paper presents an inference of access permissions. The analysis computes a symbolic approximation of the permissions owned for each heap location at each program point, infers some constraints to enforce to own enough permission when a location is accessed, and solves these constraints using linear programming. 

SAC12-InformationFlow
This paper introduces Sails, a new tool that combines Sample with a sophisticated domain for leakage analysis. This work represents the implementation of Matteo Zanioli's PhD thesis, and it is co-signed by Pietro and Agostino Cortesi.
