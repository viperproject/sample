Static Analysis of String Values
This paper presents several analyses over string values. These analyses range from simple ones (the contained surely or possibly contained in a string, the prefix and the suffix) to something more complex (briks and string graphs). This work is Giulia Costantini's master thesis, and it is cosigned by Pietro and Agostino Cortesi.
