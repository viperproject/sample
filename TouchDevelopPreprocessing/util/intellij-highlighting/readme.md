IntelliJ Syntax Highlighting for TouchDevelop
=============================================

Simply import settings.jar in Intellij Idea via
`File -> Import Settings...`

The settings also make it possible to comment out sections of code, which can
be handy.


Inspired by Stefan Heule's SIL  highlighting.
