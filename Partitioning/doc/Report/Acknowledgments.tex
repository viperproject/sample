	I would like to thank my family for the countless free meals provided during the writing of this thesis. Furthermore, I would like to thank Prof. M\"uller for the opportunity to write this thesis in his group. Last but not least, I would like to thank Pietro Ferrara for his supervision and especially for a surprisingly stable interface to \sample during the time of the project.
