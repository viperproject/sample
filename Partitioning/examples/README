This is a short guide on how to use run Sample with the examples provided in
Examples.scala. To load the file click the "File..." button and select it from
this directory.

1. ifExample
This example demonstrates the PartitionIf directive. To run without the
directive simply add the "ifExample" method select "Apron numerical analysis" for
the analysis and click "Analyze!". When asked about the property select the
"DivisionByZero" property. The analysis should report an invalid division.

Now, run the same analysis again, but this time with a PartitionIf directive
for the program point at row 5, column 21 and it should validate the division
to be safe.


2. valueExample
This time, add the "valueExample" method to the methods list, once more
select the "Apron numerical analysis" and press the "Analyze!" button. The
property of interest of this analysis is the "Bounded variable" property for
positive y. Select the property and click "Ok". The analysis should report a
warning for the assignment on line 25.

The PartitionValue directive can help prove this property with the following
parameters: The position is row 15, column 21 and the variable we would like to
partition over is "x". The intervals are (-inf,-2) where the interpolated
function is -1 - x, (-1, 1) where the function is 0 and finally (2, inf) where
the function is -1 + x.

Run the analysis and this time the previously failed assignment should validate.


3. whileExample
This example once more computes the value of a piece-wise linear interpolation.
But this time, the index for the parameters is computed in a while loop based on
the value of x.

Add the "whileExample" method and run the "Apron numerical analysis" with the
"Bounded variable" property for -4 <= y <= 4. The analysis does terminate with
a warning.

However, once we add a PartitionWhile directive for the position (35, 24)
unrolling 3 iterations it should validate.
