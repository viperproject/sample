# Ideally, IntelliJ project files whould not be part of the repository,
# because there is a constant danger of committing user-specific changes.
# We cannot remove them now because they define modules, dependencies etc.
# that are crucial for building Sample.
# As a compromise, we can ignore the files that are not necessary to
# successfully open Sample with IntelliJ.
# In the future, it might be worth migrating to Scala Build Tool (SBT),
# making it possible to remove all IntelliJ-specific files.
