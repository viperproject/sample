**Getting Started**

Refer to the wiki for information on how to compile Sample and generate
the IntelliJ project:

  https://bitbucket.org/semperproject/sample/wiki/Home


**Test Suites**

You can run all test suites in Sample on the command line using 'sbt test'.
Alternative, you can run the following end-to-end test suites using IntelliJ.

- SampleAnalysisTestSuite: Used to test for regressions
  in the heap analysis and the translation from SIL to Simple.
  This test suite does not perform specification inference.

  This test suites considers the SIL programs in
  src/test/resources/sil/issues and src/test/resources/sil/translation.

- SampleInferenceTestSuite: Performs specification inference
  and verifies the resulting programs with Silicon.
  This test suites considers the SIL programs in
  src/test/resources/sil/inference.

IntelliJ does not consider the path to the Apron library specified for SBT.
In the IntelliJ run configuration for the test suites, it is necessary
to explicitly add a VM option such as -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib

The output of the specification inference test suite contains the
extended programs.
